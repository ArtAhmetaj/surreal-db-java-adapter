# surreal-db-java-adapter
This is a simple java adapter written to communicate with the surrealdb database.

It follows the basic code convention and schema of the official golang adapter.

Things to add:
* Types for all responses instead of generic types
* Unit tests for all components
* Integration tests communicating with the database.
